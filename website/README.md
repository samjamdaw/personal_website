### What Char wants... v2
- A checklist generated from an Excel Export from Contrack.
- We will extract the relevant information from Excel and generate a new progress table.
- Char would prefer a web app solution but will need to be exported to document for printing.
- She has milestones that will remain consistent between developments, however wants the ability to add lines where applicable (maybe there is a default template which she can edit).
- Photo demo to be attached at a later date.
- She wants friction on selection in order to ensure that all actions taken are deliberate and no false edits happen. (Potentially want an audit history).


## Process
- [ ] Initial idea 
- [ ] Figma design of blue sky scenario e.g. one small developer's development. This can ensure ability to work independently after we agree moving in right direction
- [ ] Prototype of this web app solution
- [ ] Export feature
- [ ] Figma for more complex actions
- [ ] iterate
